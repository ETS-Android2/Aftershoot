<span class="c6">As a professional photographer my uncle spends around <em>eight to ten hours</em> in culling of 4000 photographs after every wedding shoot. The world is moving towards mobile cameras from DSLR. An <strong>on-device ML algorithm </strong> can automate the process to take down the time to 5 minutes or less <em>cutting down 99% </em>of the actual time spent in the process.  
With on device machine learning, the service will be able to classify images into blurry, out of focus, overexposed, underexposed, duplicates and best shots.  
This will provide a professional photographer with more time to grow his photography business, and also in the long run a platform to an amateur photographer to know what's good and what's bad photo looks like.

<h3 class="c6">Describe where your project is, how you could use Google’s help in the endeavor, and how you plan on using On-Device ML technology to bring the concept to life. The best submissions have a great idea combined with a concrete path of where you plan on going, which should include:</h3>

*   <span class="c3">(1) any potential sample code you’ve already written,</span>
*   <span class="c3">(2) a list of the ways you could use Google’s help,</span>

<span class="c3">We are working on the primary market research of this concept from past 3-4 months and results are really convincing. For the prototype, we have used  Firebase Vision Edge to classify photos into blur and unblur and overexposed and underexposed with an accuracy of 80% and 85% respectively.  
With the help of Google and the best datasets, we are aiming to achieve a higher accuracy in our algorithms  along with a possible integration of this in Google Photos.</span>

<span class="c3">With the help of AutoML and our proprietary algorithms, we have already created a Proof of concept.
